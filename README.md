# Jaywalker RL Agent

This project is a custom Gym environment designed to train RL agents in a jaywalking scenario, where the goal is to cross a road with moving obstacles safely and efficiently. The environment is set up as a grid world, where agents learn to balance waiting time and safety while navigating across the road.
