# Jaywalker RL Agent

This project is a custom Gym environment designed to train RL agents in a jaywalking scenario, where the goal is to cross a road with moving obstacles safely and efficiently. The environment is set up as a grid world, where agents learn to balance waiting time and safety while navigating across the road.

To set up the project, run the following commands:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e . # Installs the repository as a Python package for imports
```
